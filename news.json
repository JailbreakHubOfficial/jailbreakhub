    "summary": "A newly discovered vulnerability in CoreTrust could pave the way for a jailbreak on Apple's latest OS. Researchers are cautiously optimistic.",
    "content": "A significant vulnerability has been identified by security researchers within Apple's CoreTrust service, a critical component responsible for signature validation across iOS. The bug, which affects versions up to the current iOS 18 beta, could potentially allow for the bypassing of code signing checks. While a full jailbreak requires chaining multiple exploits, this discovery is a monumental first step. The community is buzzing with excitement, though developers urge patience as much more work is needed to develop a stable, user-friendly tool. This is the most promising lead for a modern jailbreak since the KFD exploit."
